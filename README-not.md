## Usage

| Function name | Description | Example | 
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `aw_data`  | Search for data by taxonomic level, full species name, a bounding box, habitat, elevation or type.     |    __Search by a species name__ <br> `aw_data(scientific_name = "acanthognathus brevicornis")` <br> __or by a genus__ <br> `crem <- aw_data(genus = "crematogaster")`  <br> __Search by a bounding box__ <br> `aw_data(bbox = '37.77,-122.46,37.76,-122.47')` <br> __Search by an elevation band__ <br> `aw_data(min_elevation = 1500, max_elevation = 2000)` |
| `aw_unique` | Obtain a list of unique levels by various taxonomic ranks    | `aw_unique(rank = "subfamily")` <br>`genus_list <- aw_unique(rank = "genus")`<br>`aw_unique(rank = "species")` |
| `aw_images` | Search photos by type or time since added.     |    ` aw_images(since = 5)`<br> `aw_images(since = 5, type = "h")` |
| `aw_coords` | Search for specimens by location and radius     |    `aw_coords(coord = "37.76,-122.45", r = 5)` |
| `aw_code` | Search for a specimen by record number   |  `aw_code(occurrenceid = "CAS:ANTWEB:alas188691")` |

This package is part of a richer suite called [SPOCC Species Occurrence Data](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc), along with several other packages, that provide access to occurrence records from multiple databases. We recommend using SPOCC as the primary R interface to AntWeb unless your needs are limited to this single source.
